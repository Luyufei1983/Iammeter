## Our Vision

To save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through our common efforts.



## Project Overview

---

Many years ago, Google had put forward a point of view that just by focusing on energy consumption, you can save a lot of energy **without any impact to your life**. For companies with large electricity consumption, saving a few percent of the energy means saving a lot of money. For families, perhaps the saving cost of a few dollars per month may not be large. However, if more people pay attention to power consumption, the cumulative energy savings will not be a small figure, which is very meaningful to gas emission reduction.  
The powermeter project of Goole had ceased. However, we consider this idea is great, so we lauch this platform now.The only difference between this system and Google's powermeter project is that any power meter and DTU which supports standard Modbus DTU protococan be connected to our plarform-*lammeter*.
